## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Investors often face difficulty in evaluating and comparing financial data across multiple companies. This project solves that by building a visual, data-driven dashboard that highlights:

- Undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals
- High-growth and high-profit companies
- Industry comparisons within the finance domain (banks, NBFCs, insurance)
- Relationships between profitability and valuation

---

## üîç SQL Insight Questions

The cleaned dataset was imported into SQL for querying key insights:

### üìä Valuation Analysis
- Top 5 companies with lowest P/E ratios
- Companies with P/E < 20 and ROE > 15%
- Highest dividend yield performers

### üí∞ Profitability
- Companies with highest ROE and ROCE
- Companies with ROE > 20% and low P/E

### üìà Growth
- Companies with >10% quarterly profit & sales growth
- Profit and sales trend comparison between NBFCs and Banks

### üè¶ Domain-Specific (Finance)
- Average ROE across banking, NBFC, and insurance
- Top financial companies by ROE and market cap

---

## üìà Power BI Dashboard Features

- KPI cards for average ROE, ROCE, P/E ratio
- Bar charts for top 10 companies by ROE, ROCE, Dividend Yield
